# User Personas for Borderland Dreams

This document describes the key user personas of the Borderland Dreams platform based on analysis of the [Borderland Dreams 2025](https://borderland.dreams.monster/borderland/borderland-dreams-2025) round and the underlying philosophy of participatory event tooling.

## Platform Overview

Borderland Dreams is a collaborative budgeting platform used by The Borderland, a participant-driven burn event in Sweden. The platform enables community members to propose projects ("dreams"), receive funding through participatory grant-making, and manage expenses for reimbursement.

But Dreams is more than a funding tool—it's a **network engine** that builds community density before the event even begins.

---

## Philosophical Framework: Dreams as a Network Engine

### The Nature of Participatory Events

At The Borderland, the boundary between organizer and attendee, artist and audience, is intentionally blurred. The organization provides only essentials (water, toilets, safety infrastructure); everything else—from stages to streetlights to art installations—is built by 4,000+ participants.

This creates a **gifting economy** where abundance emerges from participants bringing things to share, rather than consume.

### The Dense Network Theory

> *"The playa provides"* because participatory events are **denser networks** than ordinary events.

In these environments, you encounter a higher variety of people and places in a shorter time. Everyone accumulates more knowledge about available resources. The Dreams platform exists to nurture these connected networks through three mechanisms:

| Goal | How Dreams Achieves It |
|------|------------------------|
| **Increase collision rate** | Forces interactions through peer review, funding limits, and community feedback |
| **Ensure connections last** | Creates persistent relationships through co-creation, shared funding, and ongoing communication |
| **Map paths so people find what they need** | Tags, search, comments, and cross-linking help participants navigate the network |

### The Silk Road Analogy

The historical Silk Road wasn't a planned trade route—it was a resilient web formed by the **migration of sheep and nomads**. When nomads from different regions met at shared highland pastures, network paths emerged. Trade followed only *after* the network already existed.

At The Borderland, **dreams are the "sheep."** They are the mechanism that drives network formation. The funding is secondary; the primary function is creating reasons for participants to collide, collaborate, and connect.

### The Watering Hole Mental Model

> Think of Dreams not as a store where you buy art for an event, but as a **watering hole** in a vast desert.

The platform doesn't just provide "water" (funding)—it forces all the different "herds" (camps and creators) to gather in one place months before the trek begins. Because they met at the watering hole first, they already know:
- Who has the extra rope
- Who knows the way through the mountains
- Who can help if a wagon breaks down

By the time 5,000 people arrive at the event, a camp of 10 people might already know about 100+ different projects through the granting process—drastically reducing the "network jumps" required to find resources or collaborators.

---

## Primary User Personas

### 1. Dream Creator / Co-Creator

**Who they are:** Borderland participants who envision and plan projects for the event. Most dreams have 2-5 co-creators, though some have up to 10+ collaborators.

**Network Role: The Collision Point**

By proposing a dream, creators aren't just seeking funding—they are creating a "highland pasture" where nomads (other participants) meet. The dream becomes a focal point that attracts funders, reviewers, collaborators, and curious onlookers, each interaction creating a new network connection.

**How they use the platform:**

- **Create and describe their dream** with detailed descriptions, images, and custom field responses (co-existence, safety, strike plan, etc.)
- **Build detailed budgets** with itemized expenses and income (existing equipment)
- **Respond to feedback** from reviewers and community members in comments
- **Address flagged issues** when guidelines are raised
- **Advertise their project** to attract funders and future participants

**Network Impact:**
- Engage with Dream Guides and Funders months before the event
- Establish logistical paths (sharing equipment, coordinating transport) that persist beyond the art itself
- Create "collision events" that generate new relationships

**Example from the platform:**
> *"Pirates of the After"* has 5 co-creators (Fabian, Christian, Dan, Simon, and Frida) who responded thoughtfully to multiple flags about budget specificity and sustainability concerns.

> *"House Party"* (a Garage 2024 and FlimFlam co-creation) has 3 co-creators and demonstrates excellent documentation of existing equipment being brought (DJ gear, tents, decor worth millions of SEK already owned by the community). This dream explicitly mentions collaboration with "The Back Alley" camp—network paths forming through dream creation.

**Key needs:**
- Clear guidance through dream creation (custom fields prompt important planning)
- Easy collaboration tools for multiple co-creators
- Visibility into reviewer feedback and flag status
- Ability to update and refine dreams before funding opens
- Support for documenting "existing funds" (equipment already owned)

---

### 2. Participant / Funder

**Who they are:** All Borderland members who receive funds to distribute among dreams they want to support.

**Network Role: The Nomad Voyager**

Through the act of distributing tokens—especially when constrained by per-dream limits—funders are forced to explore the "highland pastures" of the community. They become decentralized nodes of information, carrying knowledge about dozens of projects back to their camps.

**How they use the platform:**

- **Browse dreams** using tags, search, and status filters
- **Distribute allocated funds** across multiple dreams (with per-dream limits per funding round)
- **Leave comments** on dreams to show support or ask questions
- **Discover what will happen at the event** - the platform serves as a "trailer" for experiences

**Network Impact:**
- The token limit system is a deliberate network-building mechanism—by limiting how much one person can give to a single dream, the platform forces participants to spread their support across many projects
- A funder researching 10+ dreams to fund becomes a scout for their entire camp
- This reduces the "network jumps" required to find resources on-site ("Who has heavy machinery?" → "Oh, I funded that dream, I know them!")

**Funding limit mechanism example:**
- Round 1: Max 20% of funds to any single dream
- Round 2: Max 50% of funds to any single dream
- Round 3: No limit

**Example from the platform:**
> *"FemDom BootCamp"* received contributions from 45 different funders, with individual funder amounts ranging from 100 SEK to approximately 3,837 SEK (the dream's total funding). **Note:** Large single contributions that appear on dreams (such as amounts exceeding individual allocation limits) typically come from FREUD during the redistribution phase, not from individual participants. For example, a contribution of 16,200 SEK to a single dream would be from FREUD's reallocation pool, not a personal funder.

**Key needs:**
- Easy discovery of interesting dreams
- Clear understanding of funding status and goals
- Ability to spread funds across many projects (the limit is a feature, not a bug)
- Connection to the event before it happens ("hype building")

---

### 3. Dream Guide / Reviewer

**Who they are:** Volunteer community members (often called "the Dream Team") who review dreams for guideline compliance before funding opens.

**Network Role: The Path Reinforcer**

Beyond checking rules, guides facilitate "collisions" by using flags (sometimes called "Startling Monsters") to prompt dialogue. They serve as the human link in the community's "caravanserai"—helping new creators navigate the social contract and connect with other dreamers who have overlapping needs.

**How they use the platform:**

- **Review dreams against 8 community guidelines:**
  - § 0 Main Rule: Don't make us invent rules
  - § 1 Be specific in your budget
  - § 2 Restricted items (alcohol, tobacco, fireworks, etc.)
  - § 3 Transport (max 20% of budget)
  - § 4 Unreasonably expensive items
  - § 5 Avoid unnecessary nice-to-haves
  - § 6 Think sustainably
  - § 7 Adherence to local laws

- **Raise flags** when guidelines aren't met, with specific feedback
- **Resolve flags** when issues are addressed
- **Mark dreams as "All Good"** when ready for funding
- **Communicate with dreamers** through comments to guide improvements

**Example interactions observed:**

> **Flag raised (§ 2 Restricted items):**
> *"I spy that you've included mimosas in your budget. Please remove those, as we can't fund alcohol!"* - Johanna (dream team)

> **Flag raised (§ 1 Budget specificity):**
> *"Make sure to provide a more detailed budget for the 3 large budget items (sound, tent, and building materials) before we can open it up for funding."* - Dream Team

> **Flag resolved:**
> *"Budget is more precise. -Tepi from the dream team"*

> **Friendly dialogue on "House Party":**
> Robin: *"Please be a bit more specific in the budget. I'm looking at 'Bedroom build' and 'Front room build' :)"*
> Johanna: *"Looking at the budget, are all the materials brand new, or are you using anything you already have? What will happen to things afterwards?"*
> Pete (dreamer): *"I've hearded the cats a bit + have got the existing funds filled in... Wood will remain unpainted and given to wood store after the burn."*
> Johanna: *"Awesome! Everyone, please fund this xxx"*

This shows how guides build relationships while ensuring compliance.

**Network Impact:**
- Each flag creates a forced "collision" between guide and dreamer
- Guides often connect dreamers with overlapping needs or resources (see Tepi connecting bus stop dreams)
- The review process transforms strangers into collaborators before they ever meet in person
- Guides accumulate institutional knowledge across hundreds of dreams, becoming critical network hubs

**Key needs:**
- Clear workflow for reviewing dreams systematically
- Ability to flag specific guidelines with comments
- Communication tools to help dreamers improve
- External integration (noted use of Coda for coordination)
- Tools to identify and connect related dreams

---

### 4. Dream Administrator / Round Manager

**Who they are:** Core organizers who manage the overall Dreams process and timeline.

**How they use the platform:**

- **Configure round settings:**
  - Set timeline (dream creation closes, granting opens/closes)
  - Define custom fields for dream submissions
  - Create guidelines with titles and descriptions
  - Set up tags for categorization
  - Configure funding limits per user per dream

- **Manage the granting cycle** through different phases:
  - Dream creation period
  - Review period (committee work)
  - Multiple funding rounds
  - Reallocation period

- **Allocate funds** to members for distribution
- **Move the process** through different phases

**Timeline observed for Dreams 2025:**
```
Feb 15      - Platform opens
Apr 1       - Dream deadline
Apr 2-17    - Committee review
Apr 17-30   - Three funding rounds
May 1-7     - Committee reallocation (FREUD phase)
May-August  - Expense submissions
September   - Final payouts
```

**Key needs:**
- Flexible timeline configuration
- Bulk operations for fund allocation
- Process stage management
- Integration with external tools (Coda, FREUD)

---

### 5. FREUD Operator / Reallocation Manager

**Who they are:** Specialized Dream Team members who manage the reallocation of remaining funds after the main granting rounds close using the FREUD tool.

**FREUD Overview:**

FREUD (Fantastic RE-distribution Utility Datasheet) is an **external Coda-based tool** that connects to the Borderland Dreams platform via API. It serves as the Dream Team's command center for managing the entire Dreams process—from pre-funding communication to post-event expense tracking.

> *"To help us, we have the fabulous F.R.E.U.D (Fantastic RE-distribution Utility Datasheet) and its algorithms. But no matter how fantastic it is, the F.R.E.U.D algorithms can't look at things like how unique a dream is, or how many similar dreams that have already been funded. It will be up to the dream committee to try to create balance and diversity."* — Dream Team communication

**FREUD's Core Functions:**

1. **Dreams Data Sync**
   - Pulls dream data from the Dreams platform API
   - Maintains a synchronized view of all dreams with their funding status, co-creators, tags, reviewers, goals, and progress
   - Shows key metrics: total budget, distributed funds, remaining budget, min budget of all dreams
   - Example: "Total budget is: 3,197,599.00kr + 100,000kr from F33(Sculpture tournament)"

2. **Mass Communication System**
   - Compose and send targeted emails to dream co-creators
   - Select specific dreams or "Add All" for bulk messaging
   - Queue batches for sending
   - Track which messages have been queued and sent

3. **Reallocation Algorithms**
   - Calculate which partially-funded dreams could reach their minimum with redistribution
   - Factor in: number of unique funders, proximity to goal, remaining budget
   - **Cannot assess:** uniqueness, quality, diversity, overlap with similar dreams (requires human judgment)

4. **Support Request Tracking**
   - Receive and manage email responses from dreamers
   - Track support tickets with "Done" status
   - Handle common issues like funding allocation errors

**Examples of Communication Observed in FREUD:**

| Phase | Message Type | Batch Size | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Pre-deadline | "Don't get stuck in draft mode!" | 127 | Remind draft dreams to publish |
| Budget review | "Hello dreamers!" | 156 | Request budget reductions (60-100% over-request) |
| Post-funding | "The funding rounds are over..." | 192 | Explain reallocation process |
| Results | "The results are in" | 101 | Announce final funding decisions |
| Merging | "Are you merging?" | 1 | Individual outreach for dream consolidation |
| Expense delay | "Apologies for the delay" | 635 | Update on receipt processing |

**How FREUD Appears in the Platform:**

When FREUD redistributes funds, it appears as a "funder" on the dream's contribution list. This is why some dreams show very large single contributions that exceed individual allocation limits.

**Example:**
> The user "FREUD" appears as a funder on many dreams with significant contributions. For instance, "Borderland Transit Authority" received 186,300 SEK from FREUD during reallocation. These are **not** personal contributions but communal fund redistribution.

**The Reallocation Decision Process:**

1. **Funding rounds close** - Some dreams reach minimum, many don't
2. **FREUD algorithms calculate** - Which dreams are closest to their goals
3. **Dream Team reviews** - Human judgment on uniqueness, diversity, quality
4. **Decisions made:**
   - Some dreams cancelled, funds released back to pool
   - Some dreams "topped up" to reach their minimum
   - Redistribution prioritizes: unique funders count, % of goal reached, community benefit
5. **Results announced** - Final funding landscape communicated

**Key Constraints Communicated to Dreamers:**

Dream Team uses FREUD to communicate keys statistics to Dreamers in an effort to collectively adjust to meet budget constraints. Example:

- Dreams requested 6.2-6.4 million SEK
- Expected budget: 3-4 million SEK
- Solution: Dreamers asked to reduce minimums by 30-50% on average
- Platform reopened for budget adjustments until April 12

**Post-Funding FREUD Functions:**

- Track expense submission status across all dreams
- Monitor which dreams have pending receipts
- Send reminder communications about receipt uploads
- Coordinate with Open Collective for payment processing

**Key needs:**
- Clear visibility into funding gaps across all dreams
- Ability to allocate from communal pool via API
- Decision support data for partial funding choices
- Communication tools for mass and individual outreach
- Integration with Open Collective for expense tracking
- Support ticket management for dreamer inquiries

**Potential Platform Integration:**

Currently FREUD operates as an external Coda document. These features could eventually be built into the Dreams platform itself:
- Mass communication system with templates and queuing
- Reallocation dashboard with algorithm suggestions
- Support ticket tracking
- Expense status overview
- Dreamer outreach history

### 6. Expense Reviewer / Coin Cat

**Who they are:** Volunteers who review submitted expenses against approved budgets and handle reimbursement workflow.

**How they use the platform:**

- **Review submitted expenses** against original budget items
- **Check expense receipts** for validity
- **Approve or reject** expense submissions
- **Track pending expenses** per dream
- **Read comment threads** for any pre-approved exceptions
- **Monitor dreams with pending expenses** for planning communication

**Expense statuses observed:**
- DRAFT
- SUBMITTED
- PENDING
- APPROVED
- PAID
- REJECTED

**The Receipt "Avalanche" Challenge:**

From the "Apologies for the delay" communication:
> *"Dear Dreamers, the Dream Team is working hard to go through all of your receipts and approve your expenses! We apologise for the delay, we were not quite prepared for the AVALANCHE of receipts you've sent in this year!"*

Common issues requiring follow-up:
1. Receipts haven't been reviewed yet (volume)
2. Questions/comments on Open Collective not answered
3. Invalid receipt formats (photos of gas stations, etc.)

**Key needs:**
- Clear expense review workflow
- Visibility into budget vs. actual spending
- Access to comment history for context
- Tracking of which dreams have pending expenses
- Deadline management for reimbursement periods
- Tools to communicate questions back to dreamers

---

### 7. Dream Tracker / Budget Manager

**Who they are:** Dream co-creators during the post-funding, pre-event phase who track purchases against their approved budget.

**How they use the platform:**

- **Track spending** against approved budget items
- **Submit expenses** with receipts for reimbursement
- **Discuss exceptions** with guides via comments when plans change
- **Monitor their budget status** as purchases are made

**Example scenario:**
> A dream's plans change and they need to buy something not originally budgeted. They use the comment system to discuss with guides to get pre-approval before the reimbursement period.

**Key needs:**
- Clear budget overview
- Easy expense submission
- Communication channel with reviewers
- Status tracking for submitted expenses
- Ability to use dream page as ongoing communication channel

---

### 8. Community Co-Creator

**Who they are:** General community members who participate in the collaborative planning process even without being official co-creators.

**Network Role: The Silk Road Cartographer**

These users identify "hotspots" and dependencies between dreams. When they comment with connections or suggestions, they are explicitly **mapping paths** between distant nodes, increasing the overall resilience of the community network.

**How they use the platform:**

- **Provide constructive feedback** on dreams through comments
- **Suggest improvements** or alternatives
- **Connect dreams** with similar themes or that could collaborate
- **Offer resources** or help
- **Draw maps** between disparate parts of the network

**Example interactions:**

> *"I also ran into this dream which also had bus stop signs. Maybe you should contact each other and see if you should co-operate?"* - Tepi connecting two related dreams

> *"It is a big financial ask for tent... I want to show you some other options to consider"* - Marcus offering alternative tent suggestions with specific product links

> *"Last year we did a pirate parade... We would love to dock our ships with at your port"* - Astrid inviting cross-dream collaboration

**Network Impact:**
- Each connection comment creates a new edge in the network graph
- Veteran participants who comment across many dreams become "super-connectors"
- Knowledge about community resources (who has what equipment) flows through these interactions

**Key needs:**
- Ability to comment on any public dream
- Easy discovery of related dreams
- Tagging/mentioning other users
- Notifications when mentioned
- Tools to see "similar dreams" or dreams with overlapping needs

## Network Roles Summary

| Persona | Network Role | Primary Function |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Dream Creator | **Collision Point** | Creates "highland pastures" where nomads gather; each dream is a focal point for network formation |
| Participant/Funder | **Nomad Voyager** | Forced by token limits to explore widely; becomes a scout carrying knowledge back to their camp |
| Dream Guide | **Path Reinforcer** | Uses flags to force collisions; connects dreamers with overlapping needs; accumulates institutional knowledge |
| FREUD Operator | **Network Optimizer** | Ensures viable dreams survive; uses algorithms + human judgment to maximize network value |
| Community Co-Creator | **Silk Road Cartographer** | Explicitly maps paths between distant nodes through comments and connection suggestions |
| Realizer | **Dependency Node** | Makes critical infrastructure visible; identifies points of failure in the decentralized network |
| Expense Reviewer | **Trust Auditor** | Closes the feedback loop; accountability reinforces network trust for future cycles |
| Dream Administrator | **Caravanserai Keeper** | Sets up the watering hole; configures when and how collisions can happen |

---

## Secondary/Composite Personas

### 9. Realizer / Responsibility Holder

**Who they are:** Participants who take on defined responsibilities for critical infrastructure or processes (Power, Placement, Safety, Event Permits, etc.). They use tools like **Realities** to map needs and dependencies.

**Network Role: The Dependency Node**

They transform the "chaos" of a decentralized event a functioning whole.

**How they connect to Dreams:**
- Dreams depend on infrastructure (power, placement, safety approval)
- Realizers review dreams that affect their domain

**Key needs:**
- Visibility into dreams that affect their responsibility area

---

### 10. Sound Camp Coordinator
Dreams tagged with "Soundcamp" have additional considerations around audio footprint and placement. They interact heavily with placement processes and sound guidelines. They are a specialized form of Realizer focused on sound policy.

### 11. Infrastructure Contributor
Dreams tagged with "Borderland infrastructure" or "Alversjö infrastructure" contribute permanent improvements. They may sometimes access earmarked infrastructure funds.

### 12. First-Time Dreamer
New participants who need extra guidance through the process. The detailed "About" section with FAQs, example dreams, and video tutorials serves this persona. They benefit most from the network effects—experienced community members help them navigate through comments and mentorship.

**Common First-Timer Confusion (observed in support):**
> *"first time dreamer here: i misunderstood the system... i didn't understand this is an all or nothing popularity contest... could you write it more clearly in cobudget directly"*
> — Synes Elischka, suggesting clearer UI for minimum budget requirements


## Conclusion

The Borderland Dreams platform serves a complex ecosystem of users with overlapping roles and evolving needs throughout the annual Dreams cycle. But its deepest function is as a **network engine**—a mechanism for building community density before participants ever meet in person.

### The Platform's Core Functions

| Traditional View | Network View |
|------------------|--------------|
| Funding distribution | Incentive for exploration |
| Guideline compliance | Collision creation (flags prompt dialogue) |
| Project documentation | Path mapping (tags, search, comments) |
| Expense management | Trust reinforcement (closing the loop) |
| FREUD reallocation | Network optimization (ensuring viable nodes survive) |

### Success Factors

The platform's success depends on:

- **Enabling "planning in the open"** - Making dreams visible creates collision points
- **Structured but flexible review** - Guidelines provide framework; interactions build relationships
- **Participatory funding** - Token limits push network exploration
- **Strategic reallocation** - FREUD ensures the community's collective choices are honored while maximizing dream viability
- **Transparent expense management** - Accountability reinforces trust
- **Community connection** - The platform builds the event before the event

### The Deeper Truth

> The funding is secondary. The primary function of Dreams is creating reasons for participants to collide, collaborate, and connect.

When 50% of participants engage in the granting process, a camp of 10 people might arrive at the event already knowing about 100+ different projects. The "watering hole" has done its work—the network exists before the first dream is built.

Each persona's experience contributes to the larger goal: transforming 5,000 strangers into a dense network of collaborators who can find anything, solve anything, and build anything together.
